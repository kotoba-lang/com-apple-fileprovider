;; run_tests.cljs — the nbb entry point for this repo's portable model tests.
;;
;; `deps.edn` already exposes the same namespace to the Clojure test runner.
;; This file exists so the tests can also be run without a JVM, which is what
;; the workspace reaches for first and what the maturity-loop mutation gate
;; drives.
;;
;; **The exit code is the result.** A test runner that prints failures and then
;; exits 0 reports a broken model exactly the way it reports a healthy one, so
;; the failure count is turned into the process status before anything else
;; happens.
